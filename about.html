      <h1>About the Author</h1>
      <p>I am a language specialist, with expertise in both natural languages, and the theory and
practice of programming languages. I have both academic
and industrial background.</p>
<p>Among others, I have done research on the following topics:</p>
<h3 id="context-free-parsing">Context-free parsing</h3>
<p>It is well-known that context-free languages can always be parsed in
<span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup>3</sup>)</span>. <a href="https://lmcs.episciences.org/1638">I wrote a certified algorithm for
that.</a>. Further most human-written
corpora of context-free languages can be parsed really fast
<span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em>)</span>. Even better, such parsing be parallelized and remain
efficient. <a href="pdf/PP.pdf">Find out why and how.</a>
I have also considered if <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2018.lilt-16.1.pdf">context-free languages can be parsed using
neural networks.</a></p>
<h3 id="logic-and-language-semantics">Logic and language semantics</h3>
<p>TODO.</p>
<h3 id="theory-of-parametricity">Theory of parametricity</h3>
<p>The way to turn a type into a logical formula giving its meaning is
given by Reynold’s theory of parametricity. Let us call such a formula
the parametric interpretation. I have contributed to
<a href="http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_135303.pdf">extend the parametric interpretation</a>
to dependent types. (The best formulation is probably
<a href="http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_127466.pdf">this one</a>).</p>
<p>Conveniently enough, in dependently-typed languages are both the types
and their logical meaning can be expressed. Furthermore, it is even
possible to
<a href="http://cs.ioc.ee/types15/abstracts-book/contrib12.pdf">extend such languages</a>
so you can turn any inhabitant of a type into the proof that it
satisfies the parametric interpretation of its type.</p>
<p>In “<a href="pdf/CCCC.pdf">Type-Theory in Color</a>” you can find some examples of
what you can do with this stuff, as well as in <a href="pdf/Doc-Revised.pdf">my thesis</a>,
which also contains updated versions of some of the linked papers.</p>
<h3 id="generation-of-polymorphic-testing-environments">Generation of polymorphic testing environments</h3>
<p>QuickCheck has shown how to test programs by generating example test
case for arbitrary properties. If your property is polymorphic, you
should look into
<a href="http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_99387.pdf">my technique</a>
to generate the cases. I am currently
<a href="posts/polytest-two.html">generalizing that technique</a>.</p>
<h3 id="linear-type-systems">Linear type systems</h3>
<p>Using linear types, one can ensure that resource-critical programs
behave correctly (statically so). One can also control optimizations
such as <a href="https://lopezjuan.com/limestone/vectorcomp.pdf">fusion</a>.</p>
<p>I have written <a href="pdf/Organ-HaskeLL.pdf">a stream library</a> in Haskell
based on linear types, and I am advocating <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-types/releases/download/v1.0/hlt.pdf">a
proposal</a>
to extend <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09756">Haskell with linear types</a>.</p>
<h3 id="programming-paradigms">Programming Paradigms</h3>
<p>I have developed a course on <a href="pp">Programming Paradigms</a>.</p>
