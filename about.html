            <h1>About the Author</h1>

            <p>I am a programming language specialist combining academic and industrial background. I have experience both with the theory and practice of programming languages. I have developed a course on <a href="pp">Programming Paradigms</a>.</p>
<p>I have done research on the following topics:</p>
<h3 id="context-free-parsing">Context-free parsing</h3>
<p>Most human-written corpora of context-free languages can be parsed really fast <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em>)</span>. Further more, such parsing be parallelized and remain efficient. <a href="pdf/PP.pdf">Find out how.</a></p>
<h3 id="theory-of-parametricity">Theory of parametricity</h3>
<p>The way to turn a type into a logical formula giving its meaning is given by Reynold’s theory of parametricity. Let us call such a formula the parametric interpretation. I have contributed to <a href="http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_135303.pdf">extend the parametric interpretation</a> to dependent types. (The best formulation is probably <a href="http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_127466.pdf">this one</a>).</p>
<p>Conveniently enough, in dependently-typed languages are both the types and their logical meaning can be expressed. Furthermore, it is even possible to <a href="http://cs.ioc.ee/types15/abstracts-book/contrib12.pdf">extend such languages</a> so you can turn any inhabitant of a type into the proof that it satisfies the parametric interpretation of its type.</p>
<p>In “<a href="pdf/CCCC.pdf">Type-Theory in Color</a>” you can find some examples of what you can do with this stuff, as well as in <a href="pdf/Doc-Revised.pdf">my thesis</a>, which also contains updated versions of some of the linked papers.</p>
<h3 id="generation-of-polymorphic-testing-environments">Generation of polymorphic testing environments</h3>
<p>QuickCheck has shown how to test programs by generating example test case for arbitrary properties. If your property is polymorphic, you should look into <a href="http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_99387.pdf">my technique</a> to generate the cases. I am currently <a href="posts/polytest-two.html">generalizing that technique</a>.</p>
<h3 id="linear-type-systems">Linear type systems</h3>
<p>Using linear types, one can ensure that resource-critical programs behave correctly (statically so). One can also control optimizations such as <a href="https://lopezjuan.com/limestone/vectorcomp.pdf">fusion</a>.</p>
<p>I have written <a href="pdf/Organ-HaskeLL.pdf">a stream library</a> in Haskell based on linear types, and I am advocating <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-types/releases/download/v1.0/hlt.pdf">a proposal</a> to extend Haskell with linear types.</p>
