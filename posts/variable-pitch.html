<p>This article aims to be a definitive reference for the use of
proportional fonts in Emacs, with emphasis on programming. In Emacs
proportional fonts are called variable-pitch faces. (More pedantry can
go here, but I’ll spare myself from writing it.) Regardless, I’m
going to call fonts whose characters do not have a fixed width
<em>proportional fonts</em>. Non-proportional fonts are also called monospace
fonts. I’ll discuss why we want them, and how well Emacs supports
them.</p>
<h1 id="why-proportional-fonts">Why proportional fonts?</h1>
<p>Simply put, proportional fonts are better than monospace fonts, <a href="https://storck.io/posts/proportional-programming-code-fonts/">even for programming</a>. This is the case at least for Latin or Greek
scripts and mathematical symbols, which is what I’m using. This fact
is partially due to cultural background, and partly due to the greater
liberty that proportional fonts allow. Speaking from personal
experience, I invariably feel more comfortable reading text typeset in
proportional fonts rather than in monospace fonts. Besides,
proportional fonts tend to use less horizontal space than monospace
fonts, saving precious screen space.</p>
<p>However there can be reasons for using monospace fonts. Such reasons
are originally only technical. In particular, early printers and
terminals could only support a fixed grid of characters. Such devices
are not in common use nowadays, but they influenced software strongly
enough that the monospace assumption persists to this day in many
contexts. In sum, there is a cultural bias for using monospace fonts,
in particular for programming.</p>
<p>I want to experiment and ignore this cultural bias as much as
possible. Emacs being an eminently customizable piece of software, I
want to investigate how far I can push the use of proportional fonts,
and report where I face technical limitations.</p>
<h1 id="successes">Successes</h1>
<p>Graphical Emacs backhands support proportional fonts alright, so we’re
already a long way there.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>We face the problem that programmers very often take advantage of
monospace fonts to align code, typically by padding code with extra
spaces (or tabs). There are two classes of alignments: alignment
relative to the start of the line (widely known as <em>indentation</em>), and
what will call tabular alignment.</p>
<h3 id="indentation">Indentation</h3>
<p>The problem of indenting with proportional fonts is that the space
character is typically narrower than most other
characters. Consequently, an indented line can appear to have a lower
indentation than it actually has. An idea is to use <a href="https://input.djr.com/info/">a font with large enough spaces</a>, but even then lines will not line up <em>exactly</em>. This
isn’t a huge problem if indentation needs only be correct relative to
other indented lines, but it becomes very significant if indentation
must be correct relatively to a non-indented line. For instance,
<code>arg1</code>, <code>arg2</code> and <code>arg3</code> should are lined up in the example below,
with a monospace font, but they won’t be with a proportional one.</p>
<pre class="example"><code>some_long_function_name_with_many_wide_characters(arg1,
                                                  arg2,
                                                  arg3)
</code></pre>
<p>In some languages, such as Haskell, this kind of indentation is
significant. So it must be taken care of. Fortunately, there is an
solution to this issue. It suffices to set the width of space
characters belonging to the indentation to be the same as the width of
the character directly above them. It is possible to implement this
because Emacs provides means to query the pixel size of displayed
characters. Yay!</p>
<p>Some further complication happens because indentation is sometimes
implemented by tabulation characters. The solution is to treat each
tabulation character as the number of spaces that it would stand for
in a monospace context.</p>
<p>This idea was proposed and implemented by <a href="https://github.com/tenbillionwords/spaceship-mode">Scott Messick</a> I added
support for tabs, optimized it and added support for indentation
guides, resulting in the <a href="https://github.com/jyp/elastic-modes">elastic-modes</a> package. This package also
supports tabular alignment.</p>
<h3 id="tabular-alignment">Tabular alignment</h3>
<p>The second kind of alignment is tables, such as:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>some_variable       = value1
some_other_variable = value2
a_third_variable    = value3
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, the previous solution does not apply, because each line
involve different non-space characters in general. Fortunately, this
kind of spacing is typically non-significant, even in Haskell. So, for
this kind of application, it is possible to use
<a href="https://nick-gravgaard.com/elastic-tabstops/">elastic tabstops</a>. The idea is to use tabulation characters to
separate column in the table, and let the editor lineup the
columns. (The link above shows elastic tabstops in action.) A pleasant
characteristic of this convention is that it one of the original uses
of tabstops on typewriters. Consequently, in some situations the table
may be displayed correctly in an editor which uses plain tabstops and
a monospace font.</p>
<h2 id="org-mode">Org-mode</h2>
<p>Org mode is mostly for inputting free-form text, and as such does not
suffer from much cultural bias towards monospace. You will however
want to configure Emacs to use a monospace font for certain elements,
such as check-boxes and tables (See below).</p>
<h2 id="gold-medals">Gold medals</h2>
<p>Some packages already have special support for proportional fonts. I’d
love it if this is the beginning of a trend and it is expected that
packages are written with proportional fonts in mind.</p>
<h3 id="vertico">Vertico</h3>
<p>The Vertico package has special support for variable pitch fonts: it
correctly aligns the annotations provided by marginalia!</p>
<h3 id="info">Info</h3>
<p>The standard <code>info</code> package correctly aligns menus</p>
<h1 id="bugs-workarounds-and-shortcomings">Bugs, workarounds and shortcomings</h1>
<h2 id="bug-window-text-pixel-size">BUG: window-text-pixel-size</h2>
<p>The technique to query the size of a character (or any text) in pixels
involves using <code>window-text-pixel-size</code>. Unfortunately it is buggy in
Emacs 28 and 29.1. One of the problem is witnessed by the following example.
Copy it in a scratch elisp file and evaluate the last line:</p>
<pre class="elisp"><code>;m soe text here
;x
;^--- 2nd character of following lines have wrong window-text-pixel-size if measured on their own.
;;note presence of NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE in the 1st line

(window-text-pixel-size nil 19 20) ; returns (0 . 27)
</code></pre>
<p>Fortunately, as far as I can tell, this bug can always be worked
around by computing the size of multiple-character regions which
overlap and subtract them.</p>
<h2 id="bug-org-mode-tables">BUG: org-mode tables</h2>
<p>Tables do not work with proportional fonts because org-mode
automatically pads them with several spaces. At the time of writing,
the algorithm which does this appears to assume a monospace font, and
thus computes incorrect results for proportional fonts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bug goes deeper. Indeed, if you set your default
font to proportional, but set the table font to be monospace, you get
wrong results. This appears to be because org-mode attempts to deal
with double-width characters. If you don’t use those, then the
following workaround seems to fix the problem:</p>
<pre class="elisp"><code>(fset 'org-string-width 'org--string-width-1)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="shortcomings">Shortcomings</h2>
<p>The following packages and functions would benefit from special support
for proportional fonts. This is not an exhaustive list, just a few
things that I personally use or that I was made aware of.</p>
<ul>
<li>marginalia: if the marginal data is multi field, then the
corresponding columns are not aligned. (See for example
<code>describe-command</code> with marginalia enabled.)</li>
<li>which-key: shows incorrectly aligned columns</li>
<li>helm: shows incorrectly aligned columns</li>
<li>dired: shows incorrectly aligned columns</li>
<li><code>describe-face</code> shows incorrectly aligned columns</li>
</ul>
