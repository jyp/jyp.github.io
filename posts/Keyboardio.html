<p>This is a review of the Keyboardio, written after a couple hours of
usage, from the point of view of a long-time Kinesis advantage user.</p>
<h1 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h1>
<p>The first impression of the Model 01 is that of excellent build
quality, which is enhanced by no-less-excellent boxing. The only
dissonant note is that the keyboard finish leaves a bit of sticky
residue on the hands; but surely this will improve with time. The
keyboard has a flashy “designer” look — likely to attract attention
at the office.</p>
<p>Right after connecting the keyboard I went into the layout
configuration process, so that it would roughly correspond to the
layout that I have on the Kinesis. I was expecting that configuring
the keyboard would be difficult (one has to flash the firmware), but
it was in fact nice and easy, even though the procedure might rebut
non-programmers.</p>
<p>In the first minutes of use, the only major issue that I have with the
keyboard concerns the switches. Keyboardio have decided to use Matias
switches instead of Cherry switches. Unfortunately, as I see it the
Matias quiet switches have a poor feel compared to the Cherry MX
browns that I’m used to. More specifically, they give a “grinding”
feel, as if some fine dust had come into the switch mechanism.</p>
<h1 id="comparison-with-the-kinesis-advantage">Comparison with the Kinesis Advantage</h1>
<p>Let’s look at the pro and cons of either option:</p>
<p>The Keyboardio Model 01 wins in the following areas, in order of
importance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split keyboard. It is great to be able to place one’s hands
anywhere one likes on the desk.</li>
<li>Configurability/hackability. (Flashable firmware, mountable
keyboard, center bars, support plates, open source design, …)</li>
<li>Portability (the Kinesis is humongous and cannot reasonably be
taken in any laptop bag.)</li>
<li>Build quality and attention to detail.</li>
<li>Beautiful design and wooden finish</li>
</ul>
<p>Kinesis wins in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better switches</li>
<li>Ergonomics. For my taste, the keywells works better for me than
adjusted key shapes. This is partly due to proper wrists rests.
The “wrist rests” on the keyboardio can be used only when not
typing. Admittedly, I have installed additional rests on the
Kinesis. But such proper wrist rests seem to be easier to install
on the Kinesis. I need to revise this point after trying some more
though.</li>
<li>The dedicated row of functions keys is occasionally useful</li>
</ul>
<p>Areas where I declare tie:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Layout. The kinesis has an additional bottom row while the Model 01
has an additional middle column. I am undecided here. I had a
difficult time adjusting to the kinesis extra row, and I probably
will have a difficult time adjusting to the additional model 01
columns.</p></li>
<li><p>LEDs. These are not trivial to configure as a properly useful
feature. Their only use (for me) is as a status reporting tool, but
I did not see how to do that easily with the provided firmware
library. Instead keyboardio provides a bunch of flashy, but
essentially useless lighting effects. Thus I declare the LEDs
useless until proven otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Thumb clusters. The thumb clusters of the Keyboardio are superior,
with all keys easy to reach. (The kinesis has 6 keys per thumb, but
one can reasonably use only 3 comfortably.) However, because I
prefer to rest my wrists, the ‘fn’ key on the keyboardio turns out
to be a nuisance. Indeed, with my typing style the ‘fn’ key would
best serve as a space bar, but then the other keys become
impossible to reach without re-positioning the whole hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Price. Both lie in the same price range.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="verdict">Verdict</h1>
<p>I applaud Keyboardio for putting together such an impressive
product. However despite the Model 01 ticking most of the boxes I feel
that the Kinesis wins in ergonomics, and that is what counts for
me. Still, I will attempt to build proper wrist rests for the Model
01, and perhaps replace the switches — if successful this may make
it the superior choice. In the meantime the main functional advantage
of the Model 01 is its portability, so I might be bringing it on
travels. It is a shame that it does not come with bluetooth
connectivity though.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations-for-keyboardio-model-02">Recommendations for Keyboardio Model 02</h1>
<p>In case Keyboardio would work on a Model 02, I am offering some tips
to them. As I see it, a Model 02 could either be a bigger keyboard
with improved ergonomics, or a smaller keyboard with good ergonomics
but focused on portability.</p>
<p>If going for improved ergonomics, keyboardio should use a keywell
instead of custom keycaps. In the build process it seemed like custom
keycaps were a major source of difficulties. Furthermore, replacing
keycaps becomes difficult (involving 3D printing), or purely dependent
on Keyboardio. A shame for an “heirloom grade” keyboard.</p>
<p>If going for portability, keyboardio should work a bit on the
footprint. Another idea would be to get rid of the leds.Save power,
save weight, cut costs, simplify the config.</p>
<p>In either case, I would recommend to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue using a split design. This is the main selling point of
the 01 — stick to that choice.</p></li>
<li><p>Use aluminum instead of wood for the top cover. Sourcing wood was
another major source of difficulty in the build. Brushed aluminum
is another fair choice, and it would also make the keyboard more
portable, as one would be less fearful of breaking the enclosure.</p></li>
<li><p>Install Cherry switches. (It’s unclear that I’ll ever get used to
the Matias switches, but at the moment I hate them.)</p></li>
<li><p>Add bluetooth capability. It would also allow the sides to work
without a connecting cable — which is an obvious win in a portable
keyboard, but also useful to freely move the sides of the keyboard
on a desk.</p></li>
<li><p>Pre-configure leds as an indicator of the current active
layer. Alternatively, have only a couple of status leds. Hopefully
this last point will be improved soon by user contributions (in fact
it may just be my shortcoming of not understanding the current
software.)</p></li>
</ul>
