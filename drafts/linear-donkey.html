<h2 id="the-issue">The issue</h2>
<p>Consider the sentence “every man who owns a donkey beat it”.</p>
<p>Quoting wikipedia:</p>
<p>Donkey sentences present the following problem, when represented in
first-order logic: The systematic translation of every existential
expression in the sentence into existential quantifiers produces an
incorrect representation of the sentence, since it leaves a free
occurrence of the variable y in beat(x,y):</p>
<p>(1) ∀x:Man. (∃y:Donkey. own(x,y)) → beat(x,y)</p>
<p>On the face of it, one must extend the scope of y so that y is
accesible in beat(x,y). Unfortunately, simply moving the quantifier
out (and changing the polarity as expected) does not yield the
preferred reading:</p>
<p>(2) ∀x:Man. ∀y:Donkey. (own(x,y) → beat(x,y))</p>
<p>Which is equivalent to stating: “every man beats every donkey that he
owns”. But that is not the preferred reading of the sentence! Indeed, we
meant to say that, given any x:Man, we could find <em>one</em> owned donkey
being beaten. Not every one of them.</p>
<h2 id="a-false-lead">A false lead</h2>
<p>In the form of dependently-typed theory, constructive logic offers a
way to apparently solve the problem. Indeed, existentials are given a
<em>constructive</em> interpretation; that is, given one proof z of
(∃y. own(x,y)), the first projection of z (written π1 z) yields the
witness that was used to construct the proof. So we can repair the
scoping issue of (1) thus:</p>
<p>(3) ∀x:Man. ∀(z:(∃y:Donkey. own(x,y))) → beat(x,π1 z)</p>
<p>Or, using the syntax of sum and product types:</p>
<p>(4) Π(x:Man). Π(z:Σ(x:Donkey). own(x,y)). beat(x,π1 z)</p>
<p>Which, by currification, is in turn isomorphic to</p>
<p>(5) Π(x:Man). Π(y:Donkey). own(x,y) → beat(x,y)</p>
<p>And, we’re back to (2). So in fact, the scoping issue is a
red-herring. Even when we fix it, using a constructive
interpretations, we have not solved the original issue.</p>
<h2 id="alternate-forall.">Alternate forall.</h2>
<p>∀₁(x:A)(B[x])</p>
<p>∃(x:A)(B[x]) + (¬A)</p>
<h2 id="beating-in-moderation">Beating in moderation</h2>
<p>Let us spell out the constructive meaning of (5). Any proof of (5) is
a device that turns</p>
<ul>
<li>any x:Man and</li>
<li>any pair of y:Donkey and a proof of <code>own(x,y)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>into a proof of <code>beat(x,y)</code></p>
<p>In particular for any given x:Man, I can use the device as many times
as I want, and thereby turn all the owned donkeys into beaten
pulps. That’s not very nice.</p>
<p>We can now see the issue: for any given man, we should be granted to
use the device a single time, so that a single donkey can be beaten:</p>
<p>(5) Π(x:Man). Π(y:Donkey). own(x,y) → beat(x,y)
<u>_______________________________</u></p>
<p>[The underlined statement should be usable just once — per x]</p>
<p>How can we express this formally? Girard offers the appropriate
language: his linear logic. Unfortunately, the linear logic box comes
only with the dual tool, linear implication (⊸), which asserts that
the <em>antecedent</em> is to be used exactly once:</p>
<p>(6) A ⊸ B</p>
<p>[A can be used only once in B]</p>
<p>If we had exactly one man a, we could provide a single:</p>
<p>Π(y:Donkey). own(a,y) → beat(b,y)</p>
<p>If we had two we could provide (a single)</p>
<p>Π(y:Donkey). own(a,y) → beat(a,y)
⊗ Π(y:Donkey). own(b,y) → beat(b,y)</p>
<p>etc. So what we want is a dependent generalisation of the tensor
product (⊗):</p>
<p>⨂(x:Man). Π(y:Donkey). own(x,y) → beat(x,y)</p>
<p>If we had exactly one man a, we could provide a single:</p>
<p>Π(y:Donkey). own(a,y) → beat(b,y)</p>
<p>If we had two we could provide</p>
<p>Π(y:Donkey). own(a,y) → beat(a,y)
⊗ Π(y:Donkey). own(b,y) → beat(b,y)</p>
<p>What we want is a dependent generalisation of the tensor product ⊗:</p>
<p>⨂(x:Man). Π(y:Donkey). own(a,y) → beat(b,y)</p>
<p>rules:</p>
<p>contexts extended with:
[x:A], Γ ⊢</p>
<p>with the meaning that Γ occurs once for every inhabitant of A</p>
<p>rules:</p>
<p>Γ, [x:A], B ⊢ x:₀ A, B, Δ ⊢
